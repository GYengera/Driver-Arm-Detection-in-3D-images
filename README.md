# Driver-Arm-Detection-in-3D-images
The code of the neural networks used for detecting the driver's arms in Microsoft Kinect depth images obtained from the Driver's Motion Depth DataBase (DMDDB).
More information about the dataset can be found at: http://research.dwi.ufl.edu/dmddb/

This approach was presented in the DMDDB track of SHREC '15, an international competition on 3D shape retrieval.
